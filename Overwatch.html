                        class="text-warning text-decoration-none">Overwatch</a> is a 2016 team-based multiplayer
                    first-person shooter game
                    developed and
                    published by
                    Blizzard Entertainment. Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of
                    six, with each player selecting from a large roster of characters, known as "heroes", with unique
                    abilities. Teams work to complete map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. Blizzard
                    has added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only
                    additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to purchase cosmetic items. It was released for
                    PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2016 and Nintendo Switch in October 2019. An optimized
                    performance patch for the Xbox Series X and Series S was released in March 2021. Cross-platform play
                    is supported across all platforms.
