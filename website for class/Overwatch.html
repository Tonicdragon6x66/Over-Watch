            <h3>What is Overwatch?</h3>
            <p>
                Overwatch is an online team-based game generally played as a first-person shooter. The game features
                several
                different game modes, principally designed around squad-based combat with two opposing teams of six
                players
                each. Players select one of over two dozen pre-made hero characters from one of three class types:
                Damage
                heroes
                that deal most of the damage to attack or defend control points, Tank heroes that can absorb a large
                amount
                of
                damage, and Support heroes that provide healing or other buffs for their teammates. Each hero has a
                unique
                skill kit, defining their intrinsic attributes like health points and running speed, their primary
                attacks,
                several active and passive skills, and an ultimate ability that can only be used after it has been
                charged
                through dealing damage to enemies and healing allies. Players can change their hero during the course of
                a
                match, as a goal of Overwatch's design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the
                situation.
                The game's genre has been described by some journalists as a "hero shooter", due to its design around
                specific
                heroes and classes.

            <h3>Game Play</h3>
            <p>
                The game features game modes for casual play, competitive ranked play, and for supporting esports
                competitions
                including Blizzard's Overwatch League. These modes generally are centered around sequentially securing
                control
                of points on the map, or escorting a payload between points on the map, with one team attacking while
                the
                other
                defends. Other modes set aside for casual matches include solo and team deathmatch, capture-the-flag,
                and
                unique
                modes run during various seasonal events. More recent updates have enabled users to craft their own game
                modes
                with a limited set of scripting tools. New characters and maps have been added regularly to the game
                since
                launch, expanding the original hero roster from 21 to 32 by April 2020. Regardless of winning or losing
                a
                match,
                players gain experience towards a player level, and on gaining a new level, receive loot boxes that
                contain
                cosmetic items that they can use to customize the appearance of the hero characters but otherwise does
                not
                affect gameplay. Loot boxes can also be purchased through microtransactions.
